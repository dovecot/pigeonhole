Compiling
---------

First of all you'll need to have built Dovecot sources available. It's also
not a good idea to build the plugin against self-compiled Dovecot sources,
but then actually use a prebuilt binary package of Dovecot. That might work
if the Dovecot versions are the same, but it's not guaranteed.

./configure --with-dovecot=../dovecot-1.0
make

# NOT INSTALLABLE YET, refer to README
#sudo make install
