v0.5.19  2022-05-10  Aki Tuomi <aki.tuomi@open-xchange.com>

	* No changes - release done to keep version numbers synced.

v0.5.18  2022-02-03  Aki Tuomi <aki.tuomi@open-xchange.com>

	- duplicate: Users without a home directory can crash with Sieve when
	  using duplicate database. v2.3.17 regression.
	- imapsieve: When mail was expunged when processing imapsieve events, a
	  crash could occur. Fixes Panic: file mail-index-map.c:
	  line 558 (mail_index_map_lookup_seq_range): assertion failed: (first_uid > 0)
	- managesieve-login: Proxy didn't support forwarding the forward_* passdb fields.
	- redirect: Sieve would crash if redirect after keep-equivalent action failed.
	- sieve: Interpreter crashes when the Sieve index extension is used with
	  index zero.
	- vnd.dovecot.filter: Envelope sender string may become corrupted when
	  Sieve scripts are using vnd.dovecot.filter. This could end up
	  corrupting mbox's From line and return wrong envelope sender string in
	  Sieve tests.

v0.5.17.1 2021-12-07  Aki Tuomi <aki.tuomi@open-xchange.com>

	- managesieve: Dovecot failed to start if ssl_ca was too large.
	- lib-sieve-tool: Binaries failed to run if ssl_ca was too large.

v0.5.17 2021-10-28  Aki Tuomi <aki.tuomi@open-xchange.com>

	- duplicate: The Sieve duplicate test is prone to false negatives when
	  the user receives many e-mails concurrently, meaning that duplicate
	  deliveries can still occur.
	- fileinto: v2.3.16 regression: Sieve delivery crashes if mail is
	  delivered to non-existing and existing folder.
	- imap-filter-sieve: v2.3.15 regression: The CPU limits on Sieve
	  execution are too easily exceeded in IMAP context (the IMAPSieve and
	  FILTER=SIEVE capabilities). Changed the default to unlimited CPU time
	  for IMAP context, since similar excessive resource usage can be caused
	  by other means as well. The CPU limits on Sieve scripts executed at
	  LDA/LMTP delivery are still enforced by default.
	- redirect:  The Sieve redirect action has protections against users
	  triggering mail loops. Unfortunately, the detection of a redirect mail
	  loop sometimes causes the message to get lost if no other Sieve action
	  is applied that delivers the message somewhere else.
	- redirect: v2.3.16 regression: With certain Sieve scripts if redirect
	  fails due to temporary failure, the lmtp process may crash after the
	  delivery. Fixes:
	  Panic: file mail-user.c: line 229 (mail_user_deinit):
	  assertion failed: ((*user)->refcount == 1).

v0.5.16 2021-08-06  Timo Sirainen <timo.sirainen@open-xchange.com>

	* .dovecot.sieve.log file now includes year in the header.
	* Change Sieve script result execution to delay definitive action
	  execution to the end of a successful Sieve script execution session.
	  This is part of an effort to solve problems with the Sieve duplicate
	  test. As a side-effect, some rare temporary-error cases yield
	  different results, in which partial failure is more likely.

v0.5.15 2021-06-21  Aki Tuomi <aki.tuomi@open-xchange.com>

	* CVE-2020-28200: Sieve interpreter is not protected against abusive
	  scripts that claim excessive resource usage. Fixed by limiting the
	  user CPU time per single script execution and cumulatively over
	  several script runs within a configurable timeout period. Sufficiently
	  large CPU time usage is summed in the Sieve script binary and execution
	  is blocked when the sum exceeds the limit within that time. The block
	  is lifted when the script is updated after the resource usage times out.
	* Disconnection log messages are now more standardized across services.
	  They also always now start with "Disconnected" prefix.
	- managesieve: Commands pipelined together with and just after the
	  authenticate command cause these commands to be executed twice.

v0.5.14 2021-03-04  Aki Tuomi <aki.tuomi@open-xchange.com>

	* IMAP FILTER command: cmd-filter-sieve - Do not allow NIL as
	  script name argument.

v0.5.13 2021-01-04  Aki Tuomi <aki.tuomi@open-xchange.com>

	- duplicate: The test was handled badly in a multiscript (sieve_before,
	  sieve_after) scenario in which an earlier script in the sequence with
	  a duplicate test succeeded, while a later script caused a runtime
	  failure. In that case, the message is recorded for duplicate tracking,
	  while the message may not actually have been delivered in the end.
	- editheader: Sieve interpreter entered infinite loop at startup when
	  the "editheader" configuration listed an invalid header name. This
	  problem can only be triggered by the administrator.
	- relational: The Sieve relational extension can cause a segfault at
	  compile time. This is triggered by invalid script syntax. The segfault
	  happens when this match type is the last argument of the test command.
	  This situation is not possible in a valid script; positional arguments
	  are normally present after that, which would prevent the segfault.
	- sieve: For some Sieve commands the provided mailbox name is not
	  properly checked for UTF-8 validity, which can cause assert crashes at
	  runtime when an invalid mailbox name is encountered. This can be
	  caused by the user by writing a bad Sieve script involving the
	  affected commands ("mailboxexists", "specialuse_exists").
	  This can be triggered by the remote sender only when the user has
	  written a Sieve script that passes message content to one of the
	  affected commands.
	- sieve: Large sequences of 8-bit octets passed to certain Sieve
	  commands that create or modify message headers that allow UTF-8 text
	  (vacation, notify and addheader) can cause the delivery or IMAP
	  process (when IMAPSieve is used) to enter a memory-consuming
	  semi-infinite loop that ends when the process exceeds its memory
	  limits. Logged in users can cause these hangs only for their own
	  processes.

v0.5.11 2020-08-12  Aki Tuomi <aki.tuomi@open-xchange.com>

	* managesieve: managesieve_max_line_length setting is now a "size" type
	  instead of just number of bytes. This allows using e.g. "64k" as the
	  value.
	- lib-sieve: When folding white space is used in the Message-ID header,
	  it is not stripped away correctly before the message ID value is used,
	  causing e.g. garbled log lines at delivery.

v0.5.10 2020-03-06  Aki Tuomi <aki.tuomi@open-xchange.com>

	* imap_sieve_filter: Change result action logging to include IMAP UID
	- vacation: Addresses were compared case-sensitively.

v0.5.9 2019-12-04  Aki Tuomi <aki.tuomi@open-xchange.com>

	+ Added events for Sieve and ManageSieve, see
	  https://doc.dovecot.org/admin_manual/list_of_events/#pigeonhole
	+ Pigeonhole: Implement the Sieve "special-use" extension described in
	  RFC 8579.
	- duplicate: Test only compared the handles which would cause
	  different values to be cached as the same duplicate test. Fix to also
	  compare the actual hashes.
	- imap_sieve_filter: IMAP FILTER Command had various bugs in error
	  handling. Errors may have been duplicated for each email, errors
	  may have been missing entirely, command tag and ERRORS/WARNINGS
	  parameters were swapped.

v0.5.8 2019-10-08  Aki Tuomi <aki.tuomi@open-xchange.com>

	- Sieve may leak resources in rare cases when a redirect, vacation or
	  report action fails to send the message. This mainly applies when
	  Sieve is executed in IMAP context; i.e., for the IMAPSIEVE or
	  FILTER=SIEVE capabilities.

v0.5.7.1 2019-07-23  Timo Sirainen <timo.sirainen@open-xchange.com>

	- dsync: Sieve script syncing failed if mailbox attributes weren't
	  enabled.

v0.5.7 2019-07-12  Aki Tuomi <aki.tuomi@open-xchange.com>

	+ vacation: Made the subject for the automatic response message produced
	  by the Sieve vacation action configurable. Both the default subject
	  (if the script defines none) and the subject template (e.g. used to
	  add a subject prefix) can be configured.
	- dsync: dsync-replication does not synchronize Sieve scripts.
	- imap_sieve_filter: Reduce FILTER=SIEVE verbosity over IMAP connection.
	- testsuite: Pigeonhole testsuite segfaulted if it was compiled with
	  GCC 9

v0.5.6 2019-04-30  Aki Tuomi <aki.tuomi@open-xchange.com>

	+ sieve: Redirect loop prevention is sometimes ineffective. Improve
	  existing loop detection by also recognizing the
	  X-Sieve-Redirected-From header in incoming messages and dropping
	  redirect actions when it points to the sending account. This header
	  is already added by the redirect action, so this improvement only
	  adds an additional use of this header.
	- sieve: Prevent execution of implicit keep upon temporary failure
	  occurring at runtime.

v0.5.5 2019-03-05  Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	+ IMAPSieve: Add new plugin/imapsieve_expunge_discarded setting which
	  causes messages discarded by an IMAPSieve script to be expunged
	  immediately, rather than only being marked as "\Deleted" (which is
	  still the default behavior).
	- IMAPSieve: Fix panic crash occurring when a COPY command copies
	  messages from a virtual mailbox where the source messages originate
	  from more than a single real mailbox.
	- imap4flags extension: Fix deleting all keywords. When the action
	  resulted in all keywords being removed, no changes were actually
	  applied.
	- variables extension: Fix truncation of UTF-8 variable content. The
	  maximum size of Sieve variables was enforced by truncating the
	  variable string content bluntly at the limit, but this does not
	  consider UTF-8 code point boundaries. This resulted in broken UTF-8
	  strings. This problem also surfaced for variable modifiers, such as
	  the ":encodeurl" modifier provided by the Sieve "enotify" extension.
	  In that case, the resulting URI escaping could also be truncated
	  inappropriately.
	- IMAPSieve, IMAP FILTER=SIEVE: Fix replacing a modified message. Sieve
	  scripts running in IMAPSIEVE or IMAP FILTER=SIEVE context that
	  modify the message, stored the message a second time, rather than
	  replacing the originally stored unmodified message.
	- Fix segmentation fault occurring when both the sieve_extprograms
	  plugin (for the Sieve interpreter) and the imap_filter_sieve plugin
	  (for IMAP) are loaded at the same time. A symbol was defined by both
	  plugins, causing a clash when both were loaded.

v0.5.4 2018-11-23  Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	* Adjustments to several changes in Dovecot v2.3.4 make this Pigeonhole
	  release dependent on that Dovecot release; it will not compile against
	  older Dovecot versions. And, conversely, you need to upgrade
	  Pigeonhole when upgrading Dovecot to v2.3.4.
	* The changes regarding the default postmaster_address in Dovecot v2.3.4
	  mainly apply to Pigeonhole. The new default should work for all
	  existing installations, thereby fixing several reported v2.3/v0.5
	  migration problems.
	- IMAP FILTER=SIEVE capability: Fix assert crash occurring when running
	  UID FILTER on a Sieve script with errors.

v0.5.3 2018-10-01  Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	- Fix assertion panic occurring when managesieve service fails to open
	  INBOX while saving a Sieve script. This was caused by a lack of
	  cleanup after failure.
	- Fix specific messages causing an assert panic with actions that
	  compose a reply (e.g. vacation). With some rather weird input from the
	  original message, the header folding algorithm (as used for composing
	  the References header for the reply) got confused, causing the panic.
	- IMAP FILTER=SIEVE capability: Fix FILTER SIEVE SCRIPT command parsing.
	  After finishing reading the Sieve script, the command parsing
	  sometimes didn't continue with the search arguments. This is a time-
	  critical bug that likely only occurs when the Sieve script is sent in
	  the next TCP frame.

v0.5.2 2018-06-29  Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	+ Implement plugin for the a vendor-defined IMAP capability called
	  "FILTER=SIEVE". It adds the ability to manually invoke Sieve filtering
	  in IMAP. More information can be found in
	  doc/plugins/imap_filter_sieve.txt.
	- The Sieve addess test caused an assertion panic for invalid addresses
	  with UTF-8 codepoints in the localpart. Fixed by properly detecting
	  invalid addresses with UTF-8 codepoints in the localpart and skipping
	  these like other invalid addresses while iterating addresses for the
	  address test.
	- Make the length of the subject header for the vacation response
	  configurable and enforce the limit in UTF-8 codepoints rather than
	  bytes. The subject header for a vacation response was statically
	  truncated to 256 bytes, which is too limited for multi-byte UTF-8
	  characters.
	- Sieve editheader extension: Fix assertion panic occurring when it is
	  used to manipulate a message header with a very large header field.
	- Properly abort execution of the sieve_discard script upon error.
	  Before, the LDA Sieve plugin attempted to execute the sieve_discard
	  script when an error occurs. This can lead to the message being lost.
	- Fix the interaction between quota and the sieve_discard script. When
	  quota was used together with a sieve_discard script, the message
	  delivery did not bounce when the quota was exceeded.

v0.5.1 28-03-2018  Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	- Explicitly disallow UTF-8 in localpart in addresses parsed from Sieve
	  script.
	- editheader extension: Corrected the stream position calculations
	  performed while making the modified message available as a stream.
	  Pigeonhole Sieve crashed in LMTP with an assertion panic when the
	  Sieve editheader extension was used before the message was redirected.
	  Experiments indicate that the problem occurred only with LMTP and that
	  LDA is not affected.
	- fileinto extension: Fix assert panic occurring when fileinto is used
	  without being listed in the require line, while the copy extension is
	  listed there. This is a very old bug.
	- imapsieve plugin: Do not assert crash or log an error for messages
	  that disappear concurrently while applying Sieve scripts. This event
	  is now logged as a debug message.
	- Sieve extprograms plugin: Large output from "execute" command crashed
	  delivery. Fixed buffering issue in code that handles output from the
	  external program.

v0.5.0.1 05-01-2018  Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	- imap4flags extension: Fix binary corruption occurring when
	  setflag/addflag/removeflag flag-list is a variable.
	- sieve-extprograms plugin: Fix segfault occurring when used in
	  IMAPSieve context.

v0.5.0 24-12-2017  Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	* editheader extension: The implementation of header modifications is
	  heavily updated. Although the functionality has not changed, the
	  underlying code was updated to address several static analysis
	  warnings, runtime integer arithmetic warnings (Clang), and to match
	  updates in the Dovecot stream API.
	+ variables extension: Made the maximum scope and variable size
	  configurable.
	+ subaddress: Support multiple recipient_delimiters.
	- enotify extension: mailto method: Fixed parsing of mailto URI with
	  only a header part.
	- enotify plugin: mailto method: Make sure the "From:" header is set to
	  a usable address and not "(null)".
	- Fixed writing address headers to outgoing messages. Sometimes headers
	  were MIME-encoded twice, yielding invalid results.

v0.4.23 20-03-2018  Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	- editheader extension: Corrected the stream position calculations
	  performed while making the modified message available as a stream.
	  Pigeonhole Sieve crashed in LMTP with an assertion panic when the
	  Sieve editheader extension was used before the message was redirected.
	  Experiments indicate that the problem occurred only with LMTP and that
	  LDA is not affected.
	- fileinto extension: Fix assert panic occurring when fileinto is used
	  without being listed in the require line, while the copy extension is
	  listed there. This is a very old bug.
	- imapsieve plugin: Do not log an error for messages that disappear
	  concurrently while applying Sieve scripts. This is a further
	  improvement on the imapsieve fix in the previous release (which fixed
	  a panic). This event is now logged as a debug message.

v0.4.22 01-03-2018  Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	- Fixed filesystem path handling problem: sieve plugin could have
	  assert-crashed with specific path lengths with: "Panic: file
	  realpath.c: line 86 (path_normalize): assertion failed: (npath_pos +
	  1 < npath + asize)".
	- Sieve extprograms plugin: Large output from "execute" command crashed
	  delivery. Fixed buffering issue in code that handles output from the
	  external program.
	- editheader extension: Extensively reworked the low-level
	  implementation of adding and removing headers. This solves a few
	  integer arithmetic problems reported by Clang runtime checks, but also
	  improves code structure and reliability in general.
	- imapsieve: Fix assert crash occurring when selected messages are
	  expunged concurrently by the time Sieve filter is to be applied.
	- imap4flags extension: Fix binary byte-code corruption occurring when
	  the setflag, addflag, or removeflag command's flag-list is a variable.
	- enotify extension: mailto method: Fixed parsing of mailto URI with
	  only a header part.
	- enotify extension: mailto method: Make sure "From:" header is set to a
	  usable address and not "(null)".
	- Fixed writing address headers to outgoing messages. It sometimes
	  erroneously applied another layer of MIME header encoding.

v0.4.21 12-10-2017 Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	* redirect action: Always set the X-Sieve-Redirected-From header to
	  sieve_user_email if configured. Before, it would use the envelope recipient
	  instead if available, which makes no sense if the primary e-mail address is
	  available.
	+ vacation extension: Allow ignoring the envelope sender while composing the
	  "To:" header for the reply. Normally, the "To:" header is composed from
	  the address found in the "Sender", "Resent-From" or "From" headers that is
	  equal to the envelope sender. If none is then found, the bare envelope
	  sender is used. This change adds a new setting
	  "sieve_vacation_to_header_ignore_envelope". With this setting enabled, the
	  "To:" header is always composed from those headers in the source message.
	  The new setting thus allows ignoring the envelope, which is useful e.g.
	  when SRS is used.
	+ vacation extension: Compose the "To:" header from the full sender address
	  found in the first "Sender:", "From:" or "Resent-From:" header. Before, it
	  would create a "To:" header without a phrase part. The new behavior is
	  nicer, since the reply will be addressed to the sender by name if possible.
	- LDA Sieve plugin: Fixed sequential execution of LDAP-based scripts. A
	  missing LDAP-based script could cause the script sequence to exit earlier.
	- sieve-filter: Removed the (now) duplicate utf8 to mutf7 mailbox name
	  conversion. This caused problems with mailbox names containing UTF-8
	  characters. The Dovecot API was changed years ago, but apparently
	  sieve-filter was never updated.

v0.4.20 27-08-2017 Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	+ Made the retention period for redirect duplicate identifiers configurable.
	  For accounts that perform many redirects, the lda-dupes database could grow
	  to impractical sizes. Changed the default retention period from 24 to 12
	  hours.
	- sieve-filter: Fixed memory leak: forgot to clean up script binary at end of
	  execution. Normally, this would merely be an inconsequential memory leak.
	  However, when the script comes from an LDAP storage, this would cause io
	  leak warnings.
	- managesieve-login: Fixed handling of AUTHENTICATE command. A second
	  authenticate command would be parsed wrong. This problem was caused by
	  changes in the previous release.
	- LDA Sieve plugin: Fixed minor memory leak caused by not cleaning up the
	  sieve_discard script.

v0.4.19 26-06-2017 Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	* This release adjusts Pigeonhole to several changes in the Dovecot API,
	  making it depend on Dovecot v2.2.31. Previous versions of Pigeonhole will
	  produce compile warnings with the recent Dovecot releases (but still work
	  ok).
	- Fixed bug in handling of implicit keep in some cases. Implicit side-effects,
	  such as assigned flags, were not always applied correctly. This is in
	  essence a very old bug, but it was exposed by recent changes.
	- include extension: Fixed segfault that (sometimes) occurred when the global
	  script location was left unconfigured.

v0.4.18 12-04-2017 Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	+ imapsieve plugin: Implemented the copy_source_after rule action. When this
	  is enabled for a mailbox rule, the specified Sieve script is executed for
	  the message in the source mailbox during a "COPY" event. This happens only
	  after the Sieve script that is executed for the corresponding message in the
	  destination mailbox finishes running successfully.
	+ imapsieve plugin: Added non-standard Sieve environment items for the source
	  and destination mailbox.
	- multiscript: The execution of the discard script had an implicit "keep",
	  rather than an implicit "discard".

v0.4.17 26-02-2017 Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	- LDA Sieve plugin: Fixed handling of an early explicit keep during
	  multiscript execution. Action side-effects and the message snapshot would be
	  lost at the final stage where the implicit keep is evaluated. This could
	  result in the IMAP flags assigned to the message to be forgotten or that
	  headers modified by the "editheader" extension would revert to their
	  original state.
	- file script storage: Amended the up-to-date time stamp comparison for
	  on-disk binaries to include nanoseconds. This will fix problems occurring
	  when both binary and script are saved within the same second. This fix is
	  ineffective on older systems that have no support for nanoseconds in stat()
	  timestamps, which	should be pretty rare nowadays.
	- file script storage: Improve saving and listing permission error to include
	  more details.
	- imapsieve plugin: Make sure "INBOX" is upper case in static mailbox rules.
	  Otherwise, the mailbox name would never match, since matching is performed
	  case-sensitively and Dovecot only returns the upper-cased "INBOX".
	- imapsieve plugin: Fixed assert failure occurring when used with virtual
	  mailboxes.
	- doveadm sieve plugin: Fixed crash when setting Sieve script via attribute's
	  string value.

v0.4.16 30-10-2016 Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	* Part of the Sieve extprograms implementation was moved to Dovecot, which
	  means that this release depends on Dovecot v2.2.26+.
	* ManageSieve: The PUTSCRIPT command now allows uploading empty Sieve scripts.
	  There was really no good reason to disallow doing that.
	+ Sieve vnd.dovecot.report extension:
	  + Added a Dovecot-Reporting-User field to the report body, which contains
	    the e-mail address of the user sending the report.
	  + Added support for configuring the "From:" address used in the report.
	+ LDA sieve plugin: Implemented support for a "discard script" that is run
	  when the message is going to be discarded. This allows doing something other
	  than throwing the message away for good.
	+ Sieve vnd.dovecot.environment extension: Added vnd.dovecot.config.*
	  environment items. These environment items map to sieve_env_* settings from
	  the plugin {} section in the configuration. Such values can of course also
	  be returned from userdb.
	+ Sieve vacation extension: Use the Microsoft X-Auto-Response-Suppress header
	  to prevent unwanted responses from and to (older) Microsoft products.
	+ ManageSieve: Added rawlog_dir setting to store ManageSieve traffic logs.
	  This replaces at least partially the rawlog plugin (mimics similar IMAP/POP3
	  change).
	- doveadm sieve plugin: synchronization: Prevent setting file timestamps to
	  unix epoch time. This occurred when Dovecot passed the timestamp as
	  'unknown' during synchronization.
	- Sieve exprograms plugin: Fixed spurious '+' sometimes returned at the end
	  of socket-based program output.
	- imapsieve plugin: Fixed crash occurring in specific situations.
	- Performed various fixes based on static analysis and Clang warnings.

v0.4.15 07-07-2016 Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	* vacation extension: The sieve_user_email setting is now used in the check
	  for implicit delivery.
	- imapsieve plugin: For any mail transaction, the mailbox was opened a second
	  time, even if no mailbox rule matched. This was unintentional, useless and
	  caused problems when the imapsieve plugin was used with other plugins like
	  acl.
	- extprograms plugin: Significantly improved error handling. No stream errors
	  were logged.
	- extprograms plugin: Fixed bug in handling of result code from remote program
	  (script service).
	- extprograms plugin: Connection to remote program service was not retried.
	- Several small fixes based on static analysis.
	- Fixed handling of quoted string localparts in email addresses.

v0.4.14 26-04-2016 Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	* The address test now allows specifying the X-Original-To header.
	+ Implemented the Sieve imapsieve extension and its IMAP counterpart
	  (RFC 6785) as a set of plugins. This allows running Sieve scripts at IMAP
	  activity, rather than at delivery. There are also facilities for the
	  familiar sieve_before/sieve_after administrator scripts. A user script is
	  defined for a mailbox using an IMAP METADATA entry, whereas administrator
	  scripts are configured using mailbox matching rules defined in the plugin
	  settings.
	+ Adjusted the Sieve ihave extension to allow capability tests to be performed
	  at runtime. This way, scripts can be written that work both at delivery and
	  from IMAP.
	+ Implemented support for runtime trace debugging. This means that detailed
	  information about which commands, actions and tests are performed is written
	  to a file. That file is created in the configured directory, but only if
	  that directory exists. This way, a particular user can be easily singled out
	  for debugging. This works much like the Dovecot rawlog facility. The trace
	  output is identical to what is produced using sieve-test with its "-t"
	  command line option.
	+ Added a "sieve_user_email" setting that configures the user's primary email
	  address. This is mainly useful to have a user email address available in
	  IMAP, where envelope data is unavailable.
	+ Implemented the dovecot-specific "vnd.dovecot.report" extension. This allows
	  sending report messages in the Message Abuse Reporting Format (RFC 5965).
	- extprograms plugin: Fixed epoll() panic caused by closing the output FD
	  before the output stream.
	- Made sure that the local part of a mail address is encoded properly using
	  quoted string syntax when it is not a dot-atom.

v0.4.13 18-03-2016 Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	* redirect action: Added the list-id header to the duplicate ID for mail loop
	  prevention. This means that the message sent directly to the user and the
	  message coming through the mailing list itself are treated as different
	  messages by the loop detection of the redirect command, even though their
	  Message-ID may be identical.
	* Changed the Sieve number type to uint64_t, which means that Sieve numbers
	  can now technically range up to 2^64. Some other Sieve implementation
	  allowed this, making this change necessary for successful migration.
	+ Implemented the sieve_implicit_extensions setting. The extensions listed in
	  this setting do not need to be enabled explicitly using the Sieve "require"
	  command. This behavior directly violates the standard, but can be necessary
	  for compatibility with some existing implementations of Sieve. Do not use
	  this setting unless you really need to!
	- redirect action: Made mail loop detection more robust by forcibly adding a
	  Message-ID header if it is missing.
	- Prevent logging a useless "script not found" error message for LDAP scripts
	  for which the entry exists but no attribute containing a script. This is not
	  necessarily an error.
	- extprograms plugin: Changed the communication channel between parent and
	  child process for a directly forked program from a socketpair to a double
	  pipe. Linux does not support /dev/stdin, /dev/stdout and friends for
	  sockets. For some shell program authors this may be confusing, so that is
	  why it is changed. When using the script service, these device nodes are
	  still not usable though.

v0.4.12 06-02-2016 Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	+ Implemented the Sieve extracttext extension (RFC 5703; Section 7). It is now
	  possible to extract body text from a message into a variable.
	* Increased ABI version due to changes in the Sieve interpreter's object
	  definitions.
	- multiscript: Fixed bug in handling of (implicit) keep; final keep action was
	  always executed as though there was a failure. This caused the keep action
	  to revert back to the initial message, causing editheader actions to be
	  ignored.
	- managesieve-login: Fixed proxy to allow SASL mechanisms other than PLAIN.
	  Before, the proxy would fail if the server did not support the PLAIN
	  mechanism.
	- ldap storage: Prevent segfault occurring when assigning certain (global)
	  configuration options.

v0.4.11 08-01-2016 Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	- Sieve mime extension: Fixed the header :mime :anychild test to work properly
	  outside a foreverypart loop.
	- Several fixes in message body part handling:
	  - Fixed assert failure occurring when text extraction is attempted on a
	    empty or broken text part.
	  - Fixed assert failure in handling of body parts that are converted to text.
	  - Fixed header unfolding for (mime) headers parsed from any mime part.
	  - Fixed trimming for (mime) headers parsed from any mime part.
	  - Fixed erroneous changes to the message part tree structure performed when
	    re-parsing the message.
	- LDA Sieve plugin: Fixed logging of actions; sometimes the configured log
	  format was not followed.
	- LDA Sieve plugin: Fixed bug in error handling of script storage
	  initialization.
	- Sieve Extprograms plugin: Ignored ENOTCONN error in shutdown(fd, SHUT_WR)
	  call.
	- Fixed duplication of discard actions in the script result. Each discard was
	  counted as a separate action, which means that action limit would be crossed
	  too early.
	- Made sure that quota errors never get logged as errors in syslog.
	- Fixed handling of implicit keep for a partially executed transaction that
	  yielded a temporary failure.
	- Fixed handling of global errors. If master and user error handler were
	  identical, in some cases the log message could be lost.
	- Fixed AIX compile issue in message body parser.

v0.4.10 13-12-2015 Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	+ Implemented the Sieve mime and foreverypart extensions (RFC 5703). These
	  are fully implemented. The interaction with the editheader extension needs
	  some work, but this should not influence most uses; i.e., changes by the
	  editheader extension are not always visible using foreverypart/mime.
	+ Sieve body extension: Properly implemented the `:text' body transform. It
	  now extracts text for HTML message parts.
	+ Sieve enotify extension: mailto method: Implemented the
	  sieve_notify_mailto_envelope_from setting. This allows configuring the
	  source of the notification sender address for e-mail notifications. This is
	  similar to what already can be configured for redirect.
	+ Added a sieve_enabled (defaults to 'yes') setting that allows explicitly
	  disabling Sieve processing for particular users. This used to be possible by
	  setting `sieve=', but ever since the sieve_before, sieve_after and
	  sieve_default settings were added, this method was not reliable anymore.
	- variables extension: Fixed handling of empty string by the `:length' set
	  modifier. An empty string yielded an empty string rather than "0".
	- Fixed memory leak in the Sieve script byte code dumping facility. Extension
	  contexts were never actually freed.
	- Fixed handling of implicit keep when the last Sieve script is a global one.
	  In that case the implicit keep action was executed in global context, which
	  could mean that trivial (quota) errors ended up in the system log file,
	  rather than the user log file.
	- doveadm sieve plugin: Fixed crashes caused by incorrect context allocation
	  in the sieve command implementations.

v0.4.9 04-10-2015 Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	* Properly implemented checking of ABI version for Sieve interpreter plugins,
	  much like Dovecot itself does for plugins. This will prevent plugin ABI
	  mismatches. 
	+ Implemented a vnd.dovecot.environment extension. This builds upon the
	  standard environment extension and adds a few more environment items, such
	  as username and default mailbox. It also creates a variables namespace so
	  that environment items can be accessed directly. I am still thinking about
	  more environment items that can be added.
	+ Sieve extprograms plugin: Made line endings of the input passed to the
	  external programs configurable. This can be configured separately for each
	  of the three extensions.
	+ ManageSieve: Implemented proxy XCLIENT support. This allows the proxy to
	  pass client information to the back-end.
	- ManageSieve: Fixed an assert failure occurring when a client disconnects
	  during the GETSCRIPT command.
	- doveadm sieve plugin: Fixed incorrect initialization of mail user. This
	  caused a few memory leaks.
	- sieve-filter command line tool: Fixed handling of failure-related implicit
	  keep when there is an explicit default destination folder. This caused
	  message duplication.
	- lib-sieve: Fixed bug in RFC5322 header folding. Words longer than the
	  optimal line length caused empty lines in the output, which would break the
	  resulting message header. This surfaced in References: headers with very
	  long message IDs.

v0.4.8 15-05-2015 Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	* LDA Sieve plugin: Dovecot changed the deliver_log_format setting to include
	  %{delivery_time}. This prompted changes in Pigeonhole that make this release
	  dependent on Dovecot v2.2.17.
	+ Implemented magic to make sieve_default script visible from ManageSieve
	  under a configurable name. This way, users can see the default rules, edit
	  them and store a private adjusted version. This could also be achieved by
	  copying the default script into the user's script storage, but updates to
	  the global sieve_default script would be ignored that way.
	+ ManageSieve: Implemented support for reporting command statistics at
	  disconnect. Statistics include the number of bytes and scripts uploaded/
	  downloaded/checked and the number of scripts deleted/renamed.
	- Fixed problem in address test: erroneously decoded mime-encoded words in
	  address headers.
	- extprograms plugin: Fixed failure occurring when connecting to script
	  service without the need to read back the output from the external program.
	- Fixed bug in script storage path normalization occurring with relative
	  symbolic links below root.
	- Fixed and updated various parts of the documentation 
	- ManageSieve: Used "managesieve" rather than "sieve" as login service name,
	  which means that all managesieve-specific settings where ignored.
	- Managesieve: Storage quota was not always enforced properly for scripts
	  uploaded as quoted string. Nobody uses that, but it is allowed in the
	  specification and we support it, so it should work properly.

v0.4.7 19-03-2015 Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	* editheader extension: Made protection against addition and deletion of
	  headers configurable separately. Also, the `Received' and `Auto-Submitted'
	  headers are no longer protected against addition by default.
	* Turned message envelope address parse errors into warnings.
	* The interpreter now accepts non-standard domain names, e.g. containing '_'.
	+ Implemented the Sieve index extension (RFC 5260).
	+ Implemented support for the mboxmetadata and servermetadata extensions
	  (RFC 5490).
	+ Implemented new sieve commands for the doveadm command line utility. These
	  commands are currently limited to ManageSieve operations, but the other
	  current sieve tools will be migrated to doveadm in the near future as well.
	+ Added more debug output about binary up-to-date checking.
	+ Added script metadata to binary dump output.
	- Fixed Sieve script binary up-to-date checking by normalizing the script
	  location.
	- The Sieve interpreter now flushes the duplicate database during start phase
	  of result execution rather than commit phase. This makes sure locks on the
	  duplicate database are released as soon as possible, preventing contention.
	- Performed a few optimizations in the lexical scanner of the language.
	- Fixed bug in `:matches' match-type that made a pattern without
	  wildcards match as if there were a '*' at the beginning.
	- Fixed crash in validation of the string parameter of the comparator tag.
	- extprograms extension: Made sure supplemental group privileges are also
	  dropped. This was a problem reported by Debian lintian.
	- Fixed bug in handling of binary errors for action side-effects and message
	  overrides.
	- file script storage: Restructured storage initialization to address
	  backwards compatibility issues.
	- dict script storage: Fixed small memory allocation bug.

v0.4.6 02-11-2014 Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	- After make distclean the distributed tarball would fail to recompile.
	  This causes problems for some distribution builds.

v0.4.5 30-10-2014 Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	+ Added a Pigeonhole version banner to doveconf output. This way, future
	  bug reports will also include Pigeonhole version information.
	- Fixed handling of implicit keep. Last version erroneously reported that
	  implicit keep succeeded after an earlier failure, while it in fact had
	  failed. Particularly occurred for mailbox quota errors. 
	- Fixed segfault occurring on SunOS systems when there is no active script.

v0.4.4 28-10-2014 Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	* Added support for Japanese mail addresses with dots at non-standard places
	  in localpart.
	* Changed handling of ENOSPACE into a normal temporary failure and added
	  handling of ENOQUOTA as a user error.
	* Restructured result execution, so that all actions which involve mail
	  storage are always committed before all others.
	+ Implemented support for generic Sieve storages. Using alternative storages
	  now also possible for sieve_before/sieve_after.
	+ Implemented storage driver for retrieving Sieve scripts from LDAP. This
	  currently cannot be used with ManageSieve.
	+ Implemented sieve_redirect_envelope_from setting, which allows configuring
	  the envelope sender of redirected messages.
	- Fixed handling of mail storage errors occurring while evaluating the input
	  message.
	- managesieve-login:
	   - Removed bogus ALERT response code returned for AUTHENTICATE command.
	   - Fixed handling of invalid initial response argument to AUTHENTICATE
	     command.
	- Fixed handling of stream errors in lexical scanner.
	- Fixed handling of SMTP errors. Permanent and temporary errors were mixed up.
	- Fixed several problems reported by CLang 3.4.
	- duplicate extension: Fixed erroneous compile error about conflicting tags
	  when `:handle' argument was used last.
	- relational extension: Fixed error handling of `:value' match.
	- editheader extension: Fixed header unfolding and header iteration.
	- mailbox extension: Fixed the `:create' tag, which erroneously subscribed an
	  existing folder.
	- extprograms plugin: Fixed handling of error codes.
	- doveadm-sieve plugin: Fixed several bugs. Synchronization of symbolic link
	  in the file storage should now also work properly.

v0.4.3 12-05-2014 Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	* Editheader extension: Made control characters allowed for editheader, except
	  NUL. Before, this would cause a runtime error.
	+ Upgraded Dovecot-specific Sieve "vnd.dovecot.duplicate" extension to match
	  the new draft "duplicate" extension.
	- Fixed sieve_result_global_log_error to log only as i_info in administrator
	  log (syslog) if executed from multiscript context.
	- Sieve redirect extension: Adjusted loop detection to show leniency to resent
	  messages.
	- Sieve include extension: Fixed problem with handling of duplicate includes
	  with different parameters :once or :optional.
	- Sieve spamtest/virustest extensions: Tests were erroneously performed
	  against the original message. When used together with extprograms filter to
	  add the spam headers, the changes were not being used by the spamtest and
	  virustest extensions. 
	- Deprecated Sieve notify extension: Fixed segfault problems in message string
	  substitution.
	- ManageSieve: Fixed active link verification to handle redundant path slashes
	  correctly.
	- Sieve vacation extension:
	  - Fixed interaction of sieve_vacation_dont_check_recipient with
	    sieve_vacation_send_from_recipient setting.
	  - Fixed log message for discarded response.
	- Sieve extprograms plugin:
	  - Forgot to disable the alarm() timeouts set for script execution.
	  - Fixed fd leak and handling of output shutdown.
	  - Fixed 'Bad filedescriptor' error occurring when disconnecting script
	    client.
	  - Made sure that programs are never forked with root privileges.

v0.4.2 26-09-2013 Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>
	
	* Incompatible change in Sieve doveadm plugin: the root attribute for
	  Sieve scripts is changed. Make sure that you update both sides of a dsync
	  setup simultaneously when Sieve is involved, otherwise synchronization will
	  likely fail.
	+ Added support for sending Sieve vacation replies with an actual sender,
	  rather than the default <> sender. Check the updated
	  doc/extensions/vacation.txt for more information.
	- Fixed a binary code read problem in the `set' command of the Sieve variables
	  extension. Using the set command with a modifier and an empty string value
	  would cause code corruption problems while running the script.
	- Various fixes for doveadm-sieve plugin, mostly crashes. These include a fix
	  for the `Invalid value for default sieve attribute' problem.
	- Various fixes for compiler and static analyzer warnings, e.g. as reported
	  by CLang and on 32 bit systems.
	- Fixed the implementation of the new :options flag for the Sieve include
	  extension.
	- Fixed potential segfault bug at deinitialization of the lda-sieve plugin.
	- Fixed messed up hex output for sieve-dump tool.

v0.4.1 03-06-2013 Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	+ Added support for handling temporary failures. These are passed back to
	  LDA/LTMP to produce an appropriate response towards the MTA. 
	- Sieve storage: Removed PATH_MAX limitation for active symlink. This caused
	  problems for GNU/Hurd.
	- Fixed line endings in X-Sieve headers added by redirect command.
	- ManageSieve: Fixed '[' ']' stupidity for response codes (only happened
	  before login).
	- Fixed setting name in example-config/conf.d/20-managesieve.conf.
	- Sieve extprograms plugin: Fixed interaction between pipe command and remote
	  script service. The output from the script service was never read, causing a
	  broken pipe error at the script service. Apparently, this was broken since
	  the I/O handling for extprograms was last revised. 
	- Fixed assertion failure due to datastack problem in message header
	  composition.

v0.4.0 09-05-2013 Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	+ Added doveadm-sieve plugin that provides the possibility to synch Sieve
	  scripts using doveadm sync along with the user's mailboxes.
	+ Added the Sieve extprograms plugin to the main Pigeonhole package. It is
	  still a plugin, but it is now included so that a separate compile is no
	  longer necessary and distributors are likely to include it. The extprograms
	  plugin provides Sieve language extensions that allows executing 
	  (administrator-controlled) external programs for message delivery,
	  message filtering and string manipulation. Refer to
	  doc/plugins/sieve_extprograms.txt for more information.
	+ Added debug message showing Pigeonhole version at initialization. Makes it
	  very clear that the plugin is properly loaded.
	+ Finished implementation of the Sieve include extension. It should now
	  fully conform to RFC 6609. The main addition is the new :optional tag which
	  makes the include command ignore missing included scripts without an error.
	+ Finished implementation of the Sieve environment extension as much as
	  possible. Environment items "location", "phase" and "domain" now also
	  return a usable value.

v0.3.6 26-09-2013 Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	- Fixed a binary code read problem in the `set' command of the Sieve variables
	  extension. Using the set command with a modifier and an empty string value
	  would cause code corruption problems while running the script.
	- Various fixes for compiler and static analyzer warnings, as reported
	  by CLang.
	- ManageSieve: Fixed '[' ']' stupidity for response codes (only happened
	  before login).
	- Fixed setting name in example-config/conf.d/20-managesieve.conf.
	- Fixed messed up hex output for sieve-dump tool.

v0.3.5 09-05-2013 Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	- Sieve editheader extension: fixed interaction with the Sieve body extension.
	  If used together, the deleteheader action could fail after a body test was
	  performed.
	- Test suite: fixed a time zone dependency in the Sieve date extension tests.

v0.3.4 06-04-2013 Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	* Changed error handling to be less of a nuisance for administrators. Strictly
	  user-caused errors are only reported in user log. Some errors are logged as
	  info instead.
	* Sieve: Changed behavior of redirect in case of a duplicate message delivery
	  or a mail loop. If a duplicate is detected the implicit keep is canceled,
	  as though the redirect was successful. This prevents getting local
	  deliveries. The original SMTP recipient is used when it is available to
	  augment the entry in the LDA duplicate database. This way, duplicates are
	  only detected when (initially) addressed to the same recipient.
	+ Sieve vnd.dovecot.duplicate extension: added new features to the duplicate
	  test, making it possible to manually compose the key value for duplicate
	  checking. This extension is in the process of being standardized
	  (https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-bosch-sieve-duplicate-01).
	+ Sieve date extension: generate warning when invalid date part is specified.
	- Sieve editheader extension: fixed crash occurring when addheader :last was
	  used.
	- Sieve include extension: fixed missing error cleanup that caused a resource
	  leak.
	- Sieve vacation extension: fixed determination of From: address for when
	  sieve_vacation_dont_check_recipient is active.
	- Sieve tools: the -D option wasn't enabled and documented for all tools.
	- Siev dict script storage: fixed potential segfault occurring when dict
	  initialization fails.
	- ManageSieve: fixed bug in skipping of CRLF at end of AUTHENTICATE command.
	- ManageSieve: fixed handling of unkown commands pre-login.
	- Fixed compile on Mageia Linux.

v0.3.3 18-09-2012 Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	- Fixed compile against installed Dovecot headers. This was broken by the
	  ld.gold fix in the previous release.

v0.3.2 18-09-2012 Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	+ sieve-refilter tool: improved man page documentation by explicitly
	  specifying the syntax used for mailbox arguments.
	+ Sieve: spamtest and virustest extensions: improved trace debugging of score
	  calculation.
	+ Sieve: made error messages about exceeding the maximum number of actions
	  more verbose.
	- Sieve tools: fixed problems with running as root: sievec and sieve-dump now
	  ignore mail_uid and mail_gid settings when run as root.
	- Sieve: fixed bug in action accounting (for limit checking): increase action
	  instance count only when an action is actually created.
	- Sieve: include extension: fixed namespace separation of :global and
	  :personal scripts.
	- ManageSieve: fixed segfault bug triggered by CHECKSCRIPT command.
	- Fixed linking with ld.gold.
	- Fixed several Clang compile warnings and a few potential bugs.

v0.3.1 25-05-2012 Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	* Added support for retrieving Sieve scripts from dict lookup. This means that
	  Sieve scripts can now be downloaded from a database. Compiled script
	  binaries are still put on disk somewhere if used. The INSTALL documentation
	  is updated with information on this new feature and the
	  (backwards-compatible) changes to the configuration. Note that his feature
	  is currently not supported for sieve_before/sieve_after or script management
	  through ManageSieve.
	+ Incorporated the sieve_duplicate plugin into main Pigeonhole tree as a
	  normal extension (vnd.dovecot.duplicate). This Dovecot-specific extension
	  adds the ability to check for duplicate deliveries based on message ID.
	  Specification can be found in: doc/rfc/spec-bosch-sieve-duplicate.txt
	+ Added support for specifying multiple sieve_before and sieve_after paths.
	  This adds much more flexibility to the multiscript configuration. One
	  application is to have user-specific Sieve scripts outside the user's
	  normal control through ManageSieve.
	+ Added a "session ID" string for managesieve connections, available in
	  %{session} variable (analogous to Dovecot change).
	- Fixed several small issues, including a few potential segfault bugs, based
	  on static source code analysis.
	- ManageSieve: changed use of EPROTO error to EIO in ManageSieve string stream
	  implementation because it is apparently not known in BSD.
	- Gave stamp.h.in (needed for autotools) some content to prevent it from
	  disappearing in patch files.
	- Fixed bug that caused a SunStudio CC compile failure (reported by Piotr
	  Tarnowski).

v0.3.0 16-02-2012 Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	* Renamed sieve_global_path setting to sieve_default for clarity. Old name is
	  still recognized for backwards compatibility. Support for the ancient (pre
	  v1.1) name for this setting "global_script_path" is now dropped.
	* Added means to prohibit use of redirect action. Setting sieve_max_redirects
	  to 0 now means that redirect is disallowed instead of unlimited. Default
	  value remains four.
	* Fixed interaction of Sieve include extension with ManageSieve. It is updated
	  to match new requirements in the draft include specification. Missing
	  included scripts are no longer an error at upload time.
	* Updated RFC2822 header field body verification to exclude non-printing
	  characters (RFC5322). Only Sieve actions that can create unstructured header
	  values (currently enotify/mailto and editheader) are affected by this
	  change.
	+ Completed sieve-filter tool to a useful state. The sieve-filter tool
	  provides a means to (re)filter messages in a mailbox through a Sieve script.
	+ Implemented the Sieve editheader extension. It is now possible to add and
	  remove message headers from within Sieve.
	+ ManageSieve: added support for reading quoted and literal strings as a
	  stream. Fixes support for handing large SASL responses (analogous to similar
	  changes in Dovecot). It is now also allowed to use a quoted string for the
	  PUTSCRIPT script argument.
	+ Added code to cleanup tmp directory in Sieve storage directory (sieve_dir)
	  every once in a while.
	+ Added support for substituting the entire message during Sieve processing.
	  This is used for the filter action provided by the new sieve_extprograms
	  plugin (provided separately for now). The filter action allows passing the
	  message through an external program.
	+ Added support for restricting certain Sieve language extensions to
	  (admin-controled) global scripts. Restricted extensions can be configured
	  using the new sieve_global_extensions setting. This is particularly useful
	  for some of the Dovecot-specific (plugin-based) Sieve extensions, that can
	  be somewhat hazardous when under direct control of users (e.g.
	  sieve_extprograms).

v0.2.6 13-02-2012 Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	* This release fixes unintentional behavior of the include extension. Included
	  scriptnames with a name like "name.sieve" would implicitly map to a script
	  file called "name.sieve" and not "name.sieve.sieve". Keep in mind that the
	  .sieve file extension has no meaning from within the Sieve language. A Sieve
	  script is always stored with an appended .sieve file extension, also when
	  the name already ends with a .sieve suffix.
	  IMPORTANT: Some installations have relied on this unintentional feature, so
	  check your script includes for issues before upgrading.
	* Matched changes regarding auth_verbose setting in Dovecot. This means that
	  this release will only compile against Dovecot v2.0.18.
	- Fixed problem in ManageSieve that caused it to omit a WARNINGS response code
	  when the uploaded script compiled with warnings.
	- Made sure that locations of Sieve error never report `line 0'.
	- Fixed potential segfault occurring when interpreter initialization fails.

v0.2.5 19-11-2011 Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	+ Sieve vacation extension: made discard message for implicit delivery more
	  verbose
	- The sieve-test tool: mixed up original and final envelope recipient in
	  implementation of command line arguments.
	- Sieve vacation extension: resolved FIXME regarding the use of variables in
	  the :handle argument. Variables are now handled correctly.
	- Sieve body extension: fixed handling of :content "message/rfc822". This now
	  yields the headers of the embedded message as required by the specification.
		Handling of :content "multipart" remains to be fixed.
	- LDA Sieve plugin: fixed problem with recipient_delimiter configuration. Now
	  falls back to global recipient_delimiter setting if
	  plugin/recipient_delimiter is not set.

v0.2.4 13-09-2011 Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	+ Vacation extension: finally added support for using the original recipient
	  in vacation address check. It is also possible to disable the recipient
	  address check entirely. Check doc/vacation.txt for configuration
	  information.
	+ Include extension: made limits on the include depth and the total number of
	  included scripts configurable. Check doc/include.txt for configuration
	  information.
	+ Implemented ihave extension. This allows checking for the availability
	  of Sieve language extensions at 'runtime'. Actually, this is checked
	  at compile time. At runtime the interpreter checks whether extensions
	  that were not previously available are still unavailable. If the situation
	  changed, the script is re-compiled and the ihave tests are evaluated again.
	+ Sieve: optimized compilation of tests that yield constant results (i.e.
	  known at compile tme), such as 'true' and 'false'. No code is produced
	  anymore for script sections that are never executed. Also, semantics
	  are not verified anymore in uncompiled script sections.
	+ Made vnd.dovecot.debug extension available to the LDA plugin instead of
	  only the command line tools.
	+ Sieve: redirect action now adds X-Sieve-Redirected-From header (mainly for
	  people using SPF/SRS).
	- Sieve: fixed bug in handling flags and keywords; in case of error an
	  assertion was triggered.
	- Script storage: improved handling of unconfigured user home directory.
	  Originally this would produce an unhelpful error message.
	- Imap4flags extension: prevent forcibly enabling imap4flags when imapflags
	  is enabled.
	- Fixed various -Wunused-but-set-variable compiler warnings.
	- Include extension: forgot to check variable identifier syntax for 'global'
	  command.
	- Sieve: fixed debug mode; no messages were logged in some situations.
	- sievec tool: forgot to enable -D (debug) parameter.

v0.2.3 14-04-2011 Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	* Sieve filter tool: finished implementing basic functionality. It is not
	  quite ready yet, but it is available for those willing to experiment
	  with it (needs --with-unfinished-features config to compile). Also
	  includes man page.
	+ Vacation extension now inhibits replies to messages from sender listed
	  in :addresses, thus preventing replies to one of the user's other known
	  addresses.
	+ Vacation extension: implemented the (draft) vacation-seconds extension.
	  This also adds min/max period configuration settings. Refer to
	  doc/vacation.txt for configuration information.
	- ManageSieve: fixed bug in UTF-8 checking of string values. This is done
	  by discarding the original implementation and migrating to the Dovecot
	  API's UTF-8 functionality.
	- Sieve command line tools now avoid initializing the mail store unless
	  necessary. This prevents sievec and sieve-dump from failing when
	  executed by root for example.
	- Enotify extension: fixed inappropriate return type in mailto URI parse
	  function, also fixing ARM compiler warning.
	- Vacation extension: fixed handling of sendmail errors. It produced an
	  additional confusing success message in case of error.
	- Removed header MIME-decoding to fix erroneous address parsing. Applies to
	  address test and vacation command.
	- Fixed segfault bug in extension configuration, triggered when unknown
	  extension is mentioned in sieve_extensions setting.

v0.2.2 06-12-2010 Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	* LDA Sieve plugin: started using Dovecot LDA reject API for the reject
	  extension. This means that the LDA reject_reason and reject_subject
	  settings now also work for Pigeonhole's LDA Sieve plugin.
	* Did some work on the new sieve-filter tool. It is mostly functional, but
	  it is not finished yet.
	* Dovecot change: services' default vsz_limits weren't being enforced
	  correctly in earlier v2.0 releases. Now that they are enforced, you might
	  notice that the default limits are too low and you need to increase them.
	  This problem will show up in logs as "out of memory" errors. See
	  default_vsz_limit and service { vsz_limit } settings.
	- Imap4flags: fixed segfault bug occurring in multiscript context.
	- Added version checking to the ManageSieve settings plugin. This plugin was
	  forgotten when the LDA plugin was updated with this change in the previous
	  release.
	- LDA Sieve plugin: fixed memory leak at deinitialization.

v0.2.1 27-09-2010 Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	+ Incorporated distinction between original and final envelope recipient in
	  Sieve interpreter, as recently introduced in Dovecot.
	+ Regex extension: added support for regex keys composed from variables.
	- LDA Sieve plugin: added _version symbol to enable Dovecot's plugin version
	  check. Without this check, people can forget to recompile the plugin, which
	  can lead to unexpected effects.
	- LDA Sieve plugin: turned debug message about an unconfigured home directory
	  into a proper error and added script path information.
	- Fixed unnecessary reporting of dummy extensions in ManageSieve SIEVE
	  capability; the comparator-i;octet and comparator-i;ascii-numeric
	  'extensions' were reported explicitly.

v0.2.0 10-09-2010 Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	* Merged Sieve and ManageSieve packages into a single Pigeonhole package.
	  There is also no need to patch Dovecot anymore to gain ManageSieve support.
	  Version numbering of previous Sieve releases is continued as v0.2.0. The
	  sources originally branched off from Sieve v0.1.5 and ManageSieve v0.11.4,
	  but the NEWS history of much more recent releases for Dovecot v1.2 is
	  included since these changes are all included in this release as well.
	* The ManageSieve service now binds to TCP port 4190 by default due to the
	  IANA port assignment for the ManageSieve service. When upgrading from v1.2,
	  this should be taken into account. The service can be configured manually to
	  listen on both 2000 and 4190.
	* The Dovecot configuration now calls the ManageSieve protocol 'sieve' in
	  stead of 'managesieve' because it is registered as such with IANA. The
	  binaries and the services are still called managesieve and
	  managesieve-login.
	* The binary representation of a compiled Sieve script is updated to include
	  source code locations of all commands and arguments. This is implemented in
	  a similar manner as such debug information is included in some system
	  executables and libraries (DWARF-like). Run-time errors can now always refer
	  to the proper line number in the Sieve source script.
	* The Sieve plugin is adapted to work properly with the new LMTP service
	  introduced with Dovecot v2.0. The same plugin is used for both LDA and LMTP.
	* The 'sieve_subaddress_sep' setting for the Sieve subaddress extension is now
	  known as 'recipient_delimiter'. Although the deprecated sieve_subaddress_sep
	  setting is still recognized for backwards compatibility, it is recommended
	  to update the setting to the new name, since the new LMTP service also uses
	  the recipient_delimiter setting.
	* ManageSieve: changed default IMPLEMENTATION capability to from 'Dovecot' to
	  'Dovecot Pigeonhole'.
	* Renamed the sieved tool to sieve-dump. The original name was somewhat
	  confusing.
	* Updated man pages to match style and structure of new Dovecot man pages.
	* Made testsuite commands more uniform and cleaned up many of the testsuite
	  scripts. Some minor new tests were added in the process.
	+ Simplified string matching API to use abstract string lists as data sources.
	  This will also make implementing the index extension easier in the future.
	+ Significantly improved trace debugging with the sieve-test tool. The full
	  execution of the script can be examined, including the matched values and
	  keys of the respective Sieve test commands. The executed statements are
	  listed with their line number (and code address when requested). The level
	  of detail is configurable from the command line.
	+ The SIEVE and NOTIFY capabilities reported by the ManageSieve protocol can
	  now be configured manually. If left unconfigured, the capabilities are
	  determined from the default Sieve and ManageSieve configuration.
	  User-specific capabilities aren't reported until after authentication.
	+ Significantly improved file error handling. This means that administrators
	  get a more useful and informative log message when file operations fail. The
	  most notable example is that when the LDA Sieve plugin is trying to store a
	  binary for a global script, the resulting failure message also points the
	  administrator towards pre-compiling the script with sievec.
	+ Added runtime argument value checking for several commands (redirect, date
	  vacation). When variables are used, these checks cannot be performed at
	  compiletime. A proper runtime error now is produced when invalid data is
	  encountered.
	+ UTF8 validity of fileinto command argument is now checked either at compile
	  time or at runtime. Previously, it was not checked until the store action
	  was executed.
	+ Validity of IMAP flags for the imap4flags extension is now checked also
	  at runtime. Previously, it was not checked until the store action was
	  executed.
	+ Simplified and restructured error handling. Also made sure that user-caused
	  errors are no longer written to the Dovecot master/LDA log.
	- Multiscript: fixed duplicate implicit keep caused by erroneous execution
	  state update.
	- Prevented assertion failure due to currupt binary string representation.
	  If the string was missing a final \0 character an assertion was produced in
	  stead of a binary corruption error.
	- Imap4flags: fixed bug in setflag command; when parameter was a stringlist,
	  only the last item was actually set.
	- Variables extension: fixed :length set modifier to recognize utf8 characters
	  instead of octets.
	- Testsuite: prevented innocent warning messages, i.e. those that are part of
	  the test, from showing up by default.
	- ManageSieve/Sieve storage: fixed error handling of PUTSCRIPT commmand; save
	  commit errors would not make the command fail.
	- ManageSieve: enforced protocol syntax better with some of the commands; some
	  commands allowed spurious extra arguments.
	- Fixed Sieve script name checking to properly handle length limit and added
	  0x00ff as invalid character.
	- Removed spurious old stdio.h (top) includes; these caused compile issues on
	  specific systems.
	- Fixed default Sieve capability (as reported by ManageSieve): extra
	  extensions spamtest, spamtestplus and virustest were enabled by default.
	  These should, however, only be enabled when properly configured and there
	  is no default configuration.

(Fused Dovecot Sieve and ManageSieve packages into a single Pigeonhole release)

Dovecot Sieve NEWS history:
---------------------------

Dovecot 1.2:

v0.1.17 19-06-2010 Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	- Made sure source code positions for compiler messages are recorded at start
	  of tokens.
	- Fixed a few potential memory leaks in the Sieve compiler and the
	  spam/virustest extensions.
	- Made command line tools return proper exit status upon failure.

v0.1.16 30-04-2010 Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	* Finished implementation of spamtest, spamtestplus and virustest extensions.
	  These are not enabled by default and need to be activated with the
	  sieve_extensions setting. Documentation available in
	  doc/spamtest-virustest.txt
	+ Vacation extension: the from address of the generated reply is now by
	  default equal to whatever known recipient alias matched the headers of the
	  message. If it is one of the aliases specified with :addresses, it is used
	  instead of the envelope recipient address that was used before.
	+ Restructured and optimized the lexical scanner.
	+ Added --with-docs configure option to allow disabling installation of
	  documentation.
	- Accidentally omitted 'extern' in two declarations of global variables in
	  header files, causing compile failures on certain systems.
	- Deprecated imapflags extension: fixed implicit assignment of flags. Turns
	  out this never really worked, but the effect of this bug was obscured by the
	  removeflag bug fixed in the previous release.
	- Fixed various memset argument mixups in enotify extension. This caused
	  warnings on certain systems, but luckily no adverse effects at runtime.

v0.1.15 25-01-2010 Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	* Enotify extension:
	  - Adjusted notify method API for addition of new notification methods.
	  - Set default importance level to 'normal' (was 'high').
	* Include extension: updated implementation towards most recent specification
	  (all should be backwards compatible):
	  - Implemented global variables namespace.
	  - Global command may now appear anywhere in a script.
	  - Implemented script name checking using the requirements specified in the
	    ManageSieve draft.
	  - One issue remains: ManageSieve currently requires included scripts to be
	    uploaded first, which is not according to specification.
	* Changed envelope path parser to allow to and from envelope addresses that
	  have no domain part.
	+ Added preliminary support for Sieve plugins and added support for installing
	  Sieve development headers.
	+ Started work on the implementation of the spamtest, spamtestplus and
	  virustest extensions (unfinished).
	+ Deprecated notify extension: implemented denotify command.
	+ Variables extension: added support for variable namespaces.
	+ Added configurable script size limit. Compiler will refuse to compile files
	  larger than sieve_max_script_size.
	+ Testsuite changes:
	  - Added support for changing and testing an extension's configuration.
	  - Added a command line parameter for copying errors to stderr.
	- Fixed a bug in the i;ascii-numeric comparator. If one of the strings started
	  with a non-digit character, the comparator would always yield less-than.
	- Imap4flags extension: fixed bug in removeflag: removing a single flag failed
	  due to off-by-one error (bug report by Julian Cowley).
	- Improved EACCES error messages for stat() and lstat() syscalls and slightly
	  improved error messages that may uccur when saving a binary.
	- Vacation extension: fixed typo in runtime log message (patch by Julian
	  Cowley).
	- Fixed use of minus '-' in man pages; it is now properly escaped.
	- Fixed parser recovery. In particular cases it would trigger spurious errors
	  after an initial valid error and sometimes additional errors were
	  inappropriately ignored.

v0.1.14 19-12-2009 Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	* Made the imposed limits on the number of redirects and the number of
	  actions configurable. The settings are called sieve_max_actions and
	  sieve_max_redirects.
	* Did a major rework of extension handling, making sure that no global state
	  is maintained. This change was triggered by problems that global state info
	  would cause for Dovecot v2.0, but it is also important for v1.2 as it
	  significantly cleans up the library implementation.
	+ Made LDA Sieve plugin recognize the deliver_log_format setting.
	+ Message headers produced from user-supplied data are now RFC2047-encoded if
	  necessary for outgoing messages. This is for example important for the
	  :subject argument of the vacation action.
	+ Added support for the $text$ substitution in the deprecated notify
	  extension.
	+ The subaddress extension now also accepts recipient_delimiter setting as an
	  alias for sieve_subaddress_sep setting. This anticipates the
	  recipient_delimiter setting in v2.0.
	- Fixed logging of mailbox names. It logged the converted mUTF7 version in
	  stead of the original UTF8 version supplied by the user.
	- Fixed a minor memory leak in the multiscript support.
	- Fixed a bug in the recompilation of Sieve scripts. Made sure that scripts
	  are only recompiled when the script file - or the symlink pointing to it -
	  is strictly newer.

v0.1.13 18-10-2009 Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	+ Body extension: implemented proper handling of the :raw transform and added
	  various new tests to the test suite. However, :content "multipart" and
	  :content "message/rfc822" are still not working.
	+ Fixed race condition occurring when multiple instances are saving the same
	  binary (patch by Timo Sirainen).
	+ Test suite: added support for testing multiscript execution.
	- Made compiler more lenient towars missing CRLF at the end of the script in a
	  hash comment.
	- Body extension: don't give SKIP_BODY_BLOCK flag to message parser, we want
	  the body! (patch by Timo Sirainen).
	- Fixed handling of implicit side effects for multiscript execution.
	- Fixed bugs in multiscript support; subsequent keep actions were not always
	  merged correctly and implicit side effects were not always handled
	  correctly.
	- Fixed a segfault bug in the sieve-test tool occurring when compile fails.
	- Fixed segfault bug in action procesing. It was triggered while merging side
	  effects in duplicate actions.
	- Fixed bug in the Sieve plugin that caused it to try to stat() a NULL path,
	  yielding a 'Bad address' error.

v0.1.12 21-08-2009 Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	+ Testsuite: added support for testing binaries stored on disk.
	+ Implemented the new date extension. This allows matching against date values
	  in header fields and the current date at the time of script evaluation.

v0.1.11 08-08-2009 Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	+ Built skeleton implementation for the date extension (RFC 5260). It
	  compiles, but it does not do anything useful yet. Therefore, it is not part
	  of the default compilation.
	- Fixed ARM portability issues caused by char type not being signed on that
	  platform. Reading optional operands from a binary would fail for action side
	  effects. Also, an accidental mixup of an int return type with bool caused
	  the interpreter to continue on ARM even though an error occured.
	- Removed direct stdint.h includes to prevent portability issues.
	- Fixed segfault bug in the handling of script open failures.
	- Include: improved user error messages and system log messages.
	- Fixed copy-paste mixup between sieve_after and sieve_before settings in the
	  LDA Sieve plugin. If only a sieve_after script was active, nothing would
	  have been executed. Patch by Mike Abbott.
	- Include: fixed a bug in HOME substitution in the sieve_dir path. Surfaced in
	  ManageSieve.

v0.1.10 03-08-2009 Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	* Changed action execution of fileinto and keep. These changes depend on API
	  additions in Dovecot, making this release depend on Dovecot v1.2.2 or newer.
	* Further developed the sieve-filter command line tool. This required a few
	  changes to the action execution of the Sieve engine. The tool was
	  successfully tested on folders with a few 100k spam messages. However, the
	  commandline options are still incomplete, a man page is missing and it needs
	  much more testing before I can recommend anyone to use this tool.
	+ Added support for the mailbox extension. This allows checking whether a
	  mailbox exists using the mailboxexists command and it adds the :create
	  argument to the fileinto command to create the mailbox when it is missing.
	  The :create feature is useless unless the Deliver LDA is run with the -n
	  option.
	+ Improved the testsuite with tests for message delivery. Messages stored
	  using keep and fileinto can be fed back into the Sieve engine for
	  verification. This includes testing of applied IMAP flags.
	+ Updated the man pages with the new method of specifying the supported
	  extensions using + and - (for the -x parameter of the sieve tools)
	+ Further developed the deprecated notify extension. A dummy for the denotify
	  command exists, meaning that its use does not cause an error anymore.
	- Fixed a bug in the derivation of the binary path from the script path. A
	  bare filename would yield a path relative to root.
	- Fixed a bug in the value matching code. The context data now uses a proper
	  pool instead of the data stack. Bug reported by Jan Sechser.
	- Fixed assertion fail in the include extension caused by missing
	  initialization upon binary load. This bug surfaces only for stored
	  binaries. Bug reported by Tom Hendrikx.
	- Fixed include error message for failed :global include. It mentioned the
	  wrong config parameter.
	- Fixed broken wiki reference in an error message of the plugin about the
	  'sieve' setting.
	- Fixed behavior of fileinto when delivering into a namespace prefix.
	  Previous fix used the wrong storage.

v0.1.9 22-07-2009  Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	* Removed the unfinished sieve-filter tool from the default build. It is now
	  only built when the --with-unfinished-features switch is supplied during
	  configure.
	+ Started building support for the ereject version of the reject action,
	  which has a preference to use an SMTP/LMTP protocol error instead of a
	  bounce message. This is to be used to make the Sieve plugin honour Deliver's
	  -e parameter. This is not yet finished and not built by default.
	+ Improved 'Permission denied' error messages just like Dovecot does,
	  precisely specifying what permission is missing to access or create a file.
	+ Added additional headers to the list of allowed headers for the address
	  test. The restrictive nature of the address test is not always appropriate.
	  Still thinking of a better, less restrictive implementation.
	+ Made the deprecated notify extension compatible with the old CMUSieve
	  plugin. However, the denotify command and the $text$ substitution are not
	  yet supported.
	+ Made the discard action log a message to avoid confusion about disappearing
	  messages.
	- Fixed behavior of fileinto when delivering into a namespace prefix. It now
	  uses silent delivery into INBOX as fallback.
	- Fixed logging of folder namespace prefix upon delivery into a prefixed
	  namespace. Formerly it only logged the bare folder name.
	- Fixed a potential segfault in the argument validation. It didn't surface
	  because no command could have a :tag followed by an associated parameter as
	  last argument.
	- Fixed segfault bug occurring in envelope test when performed on null (<>)
	  envelope path. The fix involves a rather large restructuring of the code to
	  make sure envelope addresses are properly handled everywhere (bug reported
	  by Nikita Koshikov)
	- Envelope: fixed bug in application of address parts; failure to obtain
	  the part would cause inappropriate match success (bug reported by Ron Lee)
	- Fixed extension conflict checks during validation. It could sometimes
	  produce useless errormessages. This is currently only used by the
	  deprecated extensions.
	- Forgot to remove old explicit storage library dependency (patch by
	  Arkadiusz Miskiewicz).
	- Fixed compiler warnings on certain platforms regarding the use fwrite for
	  outgoing message construction

v0.1.8 12-07-2009  Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	- Fixed AIX compile problem. For portability, the typeof operator is
	  not used anymore.
	+ Added partial support for the deprecated notify extension. However, it
	  turns out that the implementation provided by cmusieve is even older (2001),
	  meaning that this is currently not backwards compatible with cmusieve.

v0.1.7 05-07-2009  Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	+ Added support for CRLF line breaks in strbuf error handler to fix a
	  ManageSieve problem.
	+ Improved consistency of sieve tool documentation and fixed missing
	  parameters in internal tool help output.
	+ Enhanced extensions configuration, allowing to specify the enabled
	  extensions relatively to the default (patch by Steffen Kaiser).
	- Forgot to initialize script execution status in Sieve plugin, causing
	  segfaults on compile errors in specific conditions.
	- Fixed logging in Sieve plugin for execution of default main script (went
	  to STDERR).

v0.1.6 18-06-2009  Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	* Adjusted to changes in Dovecot to make it compile against v1.2.rc5
	* Made default of sieve_dir setting match the ManageSieve implementation.
	- Fixed a few problems in de body extension that caused assert failures in
	  specific situations.

v0.1.5 18-04-2009  Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	* Ported the implementation of the Sieve include extension to the latest
	  draft. This means that the import and export commands are replaced by a new
	  command called global. The import and export commands are now DEPRICATED and
	  are mere aliases for the global command. The new specification also adds the
	  :once modifier to the include command. The also newly specified global.*
	  variable namespace is not implemented yet as support for variable namespaces
	  is currently missing.
	* Did a major rework of the multiscript support for better error handling and
	  made sure that persistent global scripts (sieve_before/sieve_after) are
	  always executed, even when the user does not have a script of his own and
	  a global default is missing.
	+ Provided basic support for the environment extension. Currenly, the name,
	  version and host items are useful. Others are pending.
	+ Improved error message that is presented when an unknown Sieve extension is
	  provided as argument to the require command. It now notifies the user that
	  Sieve core commands do not need to be specified in require.
	- Fixed bug in includes at levels deeper than one.
	- Fixed bug in address matching that was caused by the failure to handle group
	  specifications. In dovecot, these are marked by address items with NULL
	  elements, which causes a segfault if not considered. The group 'undisclosed-
	  recipients:;' in particular triggered this bug. Bug reported by Bernhard
	  Schmidt.

v0.1.4 21-03-2009  Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	* Started work on the sieve-filter tool. With this command line tool it will
	  be possible to (re-)apply Sieve filters on a mail folder. It is currently
	  undocumented and far from functional.
	+ Added a custom debug extension that provides the possibility to print debug
	  messages from scripts executed by the Sieve tools.
	- Fixed issue with opening relative paths as a mail file. Bug reported by Ian
	  P. Christian.
	- Fixed MAC OSX compile problem. Turns out the extern modifier was missing at
	  multiple places. Bug reported by Edgar Fuss.
	- Fixed Solaris compile problem: removed unecessary and unportable linker
	  flags that caused compile to fail. Bug reported by Andrés Yacopino.

v0.1.3 12-02-2009  Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	* Adapted to changes in Dovecot, making this release dependent on Dovecot
	  >= 1.2.beta1
	* Made mail address comparison fully case-insensitive. This is particularly
	  noticeable for the :addresses argument of the vacation command.
	+ Finished enotify extension. Currently, only the mailto notification method
	  is implemented. All still needs to be tested thoroughly.
	+ Implemented multiscript support. It is now possible to execute multiple
	  Sieve scripts sequentially. Administrator-controlled scripts can be
	  executed before and after the user's script. Still needs to be tested
	  thoroughly.
	+ Implemented support for configuring the available Sieve extensions.
	+ Made the subaddress extension (partially) configurable using the
	  sieve_subaddress_sep setting, which allows specifying a (multi-charater)
	  separator other than '+'.
	+ Compiler now warns about invalid header field names used for the header and
	  address tests.
	+ Vacation extension now properly generates a References header for the
	  response message.
	+ Added testing of basic result execution to the test suite. Also added
	  supportfor testing the outgoing messages produced by the Sieve interpreter.
	+ Included execution of the actual result in the sieve-test command line tool.
	  The undocumented sieve-exec tool that existed for this is now removed as
	  planned.
	+ Added support for the now obsolete 'imapflags' extension for backwards
	  compatibility with CMUSieve. This also implements the mark/unmark commands.
	- Fixed bugs in the regex extension: 1) if an optional match value did not in
	  fact match, subsequent match values would get unexpected indexes. 2) fixed
	  segfault bug occurring when regex is freed.
	- Fixed bug in the use of the :from agrument for the vacation command. If this
	  address included a phrase part, the response would not be a valid RFC822
	  message.
	- Plugged a theoretical security hole occurring when a directory is opened as a
	  Sieve binary.
	- Cleaned up and fixed various log messages.
	- Fixed bug in the outgoing address verification. Addresses ending in ',' were
	  erroneously accepted.

v0.1.2 26-11-2008  Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	- Fixed important bug in the redirect action (and probably other actions like
	  reject and vacation that only send messages). This was a bug in the handling
	  of context information during the execution of actions. It caused the sieve
	  interpreter to crash with a segfault when redirect was executed.

v0.1.1 24-11-2008  Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	* Re-enabled support for compiling against dovecot headers. Much like
	  cmusieve, command line tools like sievec and sieved are not compiled in this
	  case.
	* Started implementation of enotify extension. Not anywhere near finished
	  though.
	* Adapted to changes in Dovecot on various occasions, making this release
	  dependent on Dovecot >= v1.2.alpa4.
	+ Improved logging of errors at specific occasions and added debug messages to
	  find script execution problems quicker.
	+ Removed code duplication between command line tools and the test suite.
	  Also restructured the sources of the tools.
	+ Added UTF-8 to UTF-7 folder name conversion for compatibility with IMAP.
	+ Created man pages for the command line tools. These are automatically
	  installed upon 'make install'
	+ Incorporated Valgrind support into the testsuite and fixed a few memory
	  leaks in the process.
	- Fixed compile error surfacing for gcc3.4. Forgot mask argument for the
	  open() system call when the O_CREAT flag is specified. Bug found by
	  Sergey Ivanov.
	- Fixed bug in the sievec tool. -d output was always written to stdout.
	- Fixed important bug in the imap4flags extension. When no :flags argument is
	  specified, the previous version would always use the final value of the
	  internal variable to set the flags. This means that modifications to the
	  internal variable also affected the bare fileinto/keep actions executed
	  earlier. This does not comply to the RFC.
	- Fixed bug in the include extension's import/export commands. Duplicate
	  import/exports caused problems.
	- Fixed bug in the handling of non-existent scripts. Errors were sometimes
	  ignored.
	- Dovecot omitted unfolding multi-line headers. This was added to the cmusieve
	  plugin after the code was incorporated into the new implementation. This is
	  now mplicitly fixed by concurrent change in Dovecot.

v0.1.0 23-10-2008  Stephan Bosch <stephan@rename-it.nl>

	* Initial release

Dovecot ManageSieve NEWS history:
---------------------------------

Dovecot 1.2:

v0.11.11:
	* This release contains adjustments to match changes in the Sieve API. This
	  means that this release will only compile against Pigeonhole Sieve
	  v0.1.15.
	+ Implemented ManageSieve QUOTA enforcement.
	+ Added MAXREDIRECTS capability after login.
	+ Implemented new script name rules specified in most recent ManageSieve
	  draft.
	- Fixed assertion failure occurring with challenge-response SASL mechanisms.
	- Made configure complain about trying to compile against installed Dovecot
	  headers alone.
	- Fixed compile warning for compilation against CMUSieve.

v0.11.10:
	* This release contains adjustments to match changes in the Sieve API. This
	  means that this release will only compile against Pigeonhole Sieve
	  v0.1.14.
	- Fixed compilation of ManageSieve against CMUSieve.

v0.11.9:
	* Adjusted to changes in the Dovecot login proxy API. This release
	  therefore depends on Dovecot v1.2.4.
	+ Reintroduced ability to abort SASL with "*" response. Latest ManageSieve
	  specification includes it.

v0.11.8:
	- Fixed TLS support for proxying ManageSieve. The protocol state machine
	  was incorrect. Also added a check that disables ssl when 'starttls' is
	  not enabled for the user. This produces a proper warning in the log file.
	  There is no such thing as a managesieveS protocol which has SSL from the
	  start.

v0.11.7:
	* Adjusted to changes in the Dovecot login API. This release now depends on
	  Dovecot v1.2.1 or newer.
	* Incorporated various small changes in IMAP into ManageSieve. This includes
	  properly enabling the generation of core dumps.
	- The previous release implicitly resolved the FreeBSD script truncation
	  error. This release adds a small correction to the code that detects the
	  truncation.
	- Fixed panic occurring when many errors are produced by the Sieve compiler
	  (bug found by Pascal Volk).
	- Fixed memory leak in the PUTSCRIPT command.

v0.11.6:
	* Adjusted to changes in Dovecot regarding client idle timeout vs
	  authentication timeout. This release now depends on Dovecot v1.2.rc6 or
	  newer.
	- Fixed CRLF line breaks in compile errors (bug reported by Pascal Volk).
	- Corrected directory/file creation behavior with respect to mode bits
	  and gid (bug reported by Pascal Volk).
	- Improved handling of script truncation bugs: connection is now closed and
	  an error is logged. bug itself not fixed yet).
	- Prevented temp script name from showing up in error output.

v0.11.5:
	* Incorporated various changes from imap-login into managesieve-login. This
	  includes changes in the proxy support.

v0.11.4:
	* Adjusted to changes in the Dovecot signal handler API.

v0.11.3:
	* Changed the SASL service name from "managesieve" into "sieve" as required
	  in the protocol specification. Don't forget to adjust your configuration
	  if your authentication mechanism depends on this service name.
	* Adapted to changes in Dovecot, making this release dependent on Dovecot
	  >= v1.2.beta1.
	* Adapted to changes in the new Sieve implementation, making this release
	  dependent on Dovecot Sieve >= v0.1.3 if used. The old cmusieve plugin is
	  still supported.
	+ Implemented making the SIEVE and NOTIFY capability fully dynamic, meaning
	  that the sieve_extensions setting that was introduced for the new Sieve
	  plugin properly affects the ManageSieve daemon as well.
	+ Added support for the CHECKSCRIPT command. In terms of the supported
	  commands, the ManageSieve daemon now complies with protocol VERSION 1.0 as
	  listed in the CAPABILITY response.
	- Fixed maximum permissions for uploaded scripts; was 0777. This
	  was shielded however by the default umask (not documented to be
	  configurable), so the actual permissions would never have been 0777.
	- Fixed a segfault bug in the authentication time-out. Bug report and trace
	  provided by Wolfgang Friebel.
	- Fixed handling of ~/ in use of mail-data for script location.
	- Fixed small problems in the login proxy support.

v0.11.2:
	* Adapted to changes in Dovecot, making this release dependent on Dovecot
	  >= v1.2.alpa4.

v0.11.1:
	- Fixed security issue that gives virtual users the ability to read and
	  modify each other's scripts if the directory structure of the sieve
	  storage is known.
	* Updated NOOP command to match new protocol specification
	+ Improved error handling and implemented the new response codes:
	  ACTIVE, NONEXISTENT, ALREADYEXISTS and WARNINGS

v0.11.0:
	* Upgraded to Dovecot v1.2
	* Added support for new ManageSieve extensions RENAME and NOOP
	* Moved sieve settings to plugin {} section of config file. Now the settings
	  `sieve` and `sieve_dir` in the plugin section are used for the Sieve plugin
	  and the ManageSieve service, avoiding the posibility of accidental
	  differences in configuration.

Dovecot 1.1:

v0.10.3
	* Removed erroneous inline declarations that caused compiler warnings. GCC 4.3
	  turns out to fail entirely as reported by Joel Johnson.
	* Fixed auto-dectection of Sieve implementation during ./configure. It now
	  produces a proper error when the directory is invalid.

v0.10.2
	* Fixed bug that caused SASL mechanisms that require more than a single client
	  response to fail. Reported by Steffen Kaiser and occured when he tried using
	  the (obsolete) LOGIN mechanism.
	* Updated installation and configuration documentation to match the
	  information provided in the wiki

v0.10.1
	* Fixed bug introduced in v0.10.0: compiled scripts were also written to disk
	  in the sieve/tmp directory and left there. This accumulates much .sievec
	  junk in that directory over time.
	* Fixed bug in tmp file generation for sieve-storage: errors other than EEXIST
	  would cause the daemon to sleep() loop indefinitely.

	+ Improved log lines to be more recognizable as being generated from
	  managesieve.
	+ Added short proxy configuration explanation to the README file
	+ Added 'Known Issues' section to the README file
	- Fixed assert bug in sieve-storage occurring when save is canceled.

v0.10.0
	* Upgraded to Dovecot 1.1:
		- The actual managesieve implementation is now a separate package.
		  The dovecot tree still needs to be patched though to make dovecot
		  recognize the new managesieve service.
		- Incorporated changes to imap/imap-login into the equivalent
		  managesieve processes.
		- Removed cmusieve implementation from managesieve sources. It is
		  now linked externally from the dovecot-sieve-1.1 package.
		- Restructured README.managesieve file into separate README, NEWS,
		  TODO, DESIGN and INSTALL files.
	* Added support for new libsieve implementation (to be released). This
	  package can be compiled with either the new or the old Sieve
	  implementation (autodetected). If the new Sieve becomes stable, this
	  package will be merged with it to make a single package for Dovecot
	  Sieve support.

Dovecot 1.0:

v9

+ Definitively fixed the segfault mentioned in V8. It proved to be
  very time-constrained and thus hard to reproduce. The error turned out
  to be related to the input handling of the login daemon during
  authentication.
+ Checked for changes in the imap daemon that weren't propagated to the
  managesieve implementation due to code duplication.
+ Fixed a bug in the autodetection of the sieve storage location.
+ Fixed bug in the sieve storage that failed to refresh the symlink if
  the storage was moved.
+ Improved error handing in the sieve-storage implementation in various
  places.
+ Fixed the situation in which the active script link is located in the
  sieve storage.
+ Added managesieve configuration to dovecot-example.conf and made the example
  in this file more concise.

v8

+ Fixed a few incompatibilities with 1.0.7 version. For instance, the "Logged
  in" message is now sent by the -login process and not by the managesieve
  daemon anymore. This caused a segfault every once in a while.
+ Probably fixed the settings problem reported by Steffen Kaiser regarding
  login_dir. 'dovecot -n' now reports correct results, but testing will show
  whether the whole problem is solved.
+ The managesieve daemon now accepts the sieve_storage and sieve configuration
  settings, so it is now possible to explicitly configure the location of the
  sieve storage and the active script respectively. The daemon still falls back
  to using the mail_location (MAIL) settings if nothing else is specified.
+ The cyrus timsieved does not use the + character in string literals and many
  clients have adopted to this behaviour. The latest managesieve (08) advises to
  accept a missing + from clients. The server should not send any + characters
  as well. This behavior is now implemented on the server.
+ Cleaned up sieve-storage.c: split up the sieve_storage_create function in
  various sub-functions for obtaining the various paths and directories.
+ Forced manual intervention if rescueing a non-symlink file at the active script
  path fails somehow. Previously, this presented the admin with a log message
  that it had just eaten the script, which is not very nice.
+ Restructured the README.managesieve file and added some more explanation with
  regard to the configuration of the daemon.

v7

- Robin Breathe indicated that the regex capability was missing in the server's
  SIEVE listing. It turns out I forgot to make arrangements for setting
  ENABLE_REGEX in the cmu libsieve sources, so the regex extension was not
  compiled in. I copied the configure.in section regarding ENABLE_REGEX from
  dovecot-sieve-1.0.2 and that fixed the problem.

v6

- Corked the client output stream while producing the capability greeting and on
  other some other occasions as well. Some naive client implementations expect to
  receive this as a single tcp frame and it is a good practice to do so anyway.
  Using this change the Thunderbird sieve extension (v0.1.1) seemed to work. However,
  scripts larger than a tcp frame still caused failures. All these issues are fixed
  in the latest version of the sieve add-on (currently v0.1.4).
- Cleaned up the new proxy source. My editor made the indentation a complete mess
  in terms of TABs vs spaces.
- Added TRYLATER response codes to BYE and NO messages where appropriate.
- Recopied the libsieve library into this patch to incorporate any changes that were
  made (only sieve-cmu.c still needs to be compared to the old cmu-sieve.c). This
  also solves the __attribute__((unused)) GCC dependencies. These were fixed long
  ago by Timo....  the code duplication beast strikes again.
- Removed spurious return value from void function in
  src/lib-sieve/sieve-implementation.c as reported by Robin Breathe. GCC fails to
  report these issues. The function involved is currently not used and serves only
  as an example on how dovecot could support multiple sieve backends...

v5

- Applied patch by Uldis Pakuls to fix master_dump_settings bug
- Added some compilation/installation info to this README
- Moved README to source tree root as README.managesieve
- Fixed minor error handling bug in sieve_storage.c with respect to a missing
  root directory.
- Now sieve capabilities are reported as they are specified by the implementing
  library and not in forced upper case. The sieve RFC now explicitly states
  that sieve capability identifiers are case-sensitive. This broke compatibility
  with SquirrelMail/Avelsieve.
- Disabled ANONYMOUS login entirely until proper support is implemented. V4
  claimed to do so as well, but in fact it only stopped announcing it.
- Implemented managesieve-proxy. It is not so much a clean copy of imap-proxy,
  since the managesieve greeting is much more complex and requires parsing.
  Configuration is identical to imap-proxy. This seems to be a little under-
  documented however (http://wiki.dovecot.org/PasswordDatabase/ExtraFields).

v4

- Added managesieve_implementation_string setting to the managesieve
  configuration. This can be used to customize the default "IMPLEMENTATION"
  capability response.
- Denied ANONYMOUS login until proper support is implemented
- Fixed problem with authenticate command regarding continued responses. In
  V3 only initial response would work. Problem was caused by rc2 -> rc28
  upgrade. One of the clear reasons why code duplication is a very bad idea.
- Fixed readlink bug as indicated by Timo: return value of readlink can also
  be -1.
- Fixed bug in the regular file rescue code, as introduced in the previous
  version. Used stat instead of lstat. This caused the symlink to be rescued
  subsequently in the next activation, thus still overwriting the initially
  rescued script.

v3

- Updated source to compile with dovecot 1.0.rc27
- Daemon now uses the same location for .dovecot.sieve as dovecot-lda
  This is typically ~/.dovecot.sieve
- If .dovecot.sieve is a regular file, it is now moved into the script storage as
  dovecot.orig.sieve, preventing deletion of (important) active scripts
  upon upgrade.
- Changed error handling to yield a BYE message when the managesieve
  daemon exits unexpectedly (upon login) before any commands are entered.
  Horde-ingo would wait indefinitely for a response.

v2

- Fixed the bug (missing CRLF) in the authenticate command
- Modified the sieve storage library making the interface much less crude.
- The scripts put on the server using the putscript command are now
  checked before they are accepted.
- The reported SIEVE capability is now directly read from the sieve
  implementation (in this case cmu), listing much more than "FILEINTO
  VACATION".
- Imported instance of libsieve source into this patch for implementation
  of script checking and capability listing. THIS NEEDS TO BE CHANGED!
- Fixed some minor bugs in the putscript command
