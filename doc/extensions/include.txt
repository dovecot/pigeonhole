Relevant Specifications
=======================

  draft-ietf-sieve-include-05 - doc/rfc/draft-ietf-sieve-include-05.txt

Description
===========

The Sieve include extension permits users to include one Sieve script into
another. This can make managing large scripts or multiple sets of scripts much
easier, and allows a site and its users to build up libraries of scripts. Users
are able to include their own personal scripts or site-wide scripts.

Included scripts can include more scripts of their own, yielding a tree of
included scripts with the main script (typically the user's personal script) at
its root.

Configuration
=============

The include extension is available by default. The include extension has its own
specific settings. The following settings can be configured for the include
extension (default values are indicated):

sieve_include_max_includes = 255
  The maximum number of scripts that may be included. This is the total number
  of scripts involved in the include tree.

sieve_include_max_nesting_depth = 10
  The maximum nesting depth for the include tree.
