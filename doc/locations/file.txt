FILE Sieve Script Location Type

Description
===========

This location type is used to retrieve Sieve scripts from the file system. The
location can either point to a directory or to a regular file. If the location
points to a directory, a script called "name" is retrieved by reading a file
from that directory with the file name "name.sieve".

When this location type is involved in a sieve_before/sieve_after script
sequence and the location points to a directory, all files in that directory
with a ".sieve" extension are part of the sequence. The sequence order of the
scripts in that directory is determined by the file names, using a normal 8bit
per-character comparison.
 
Unless overridden using the `bindir=<path>' location option, compiled binaries
for scripts retrieved from the `file' location type are by default stored in the
same directory as where the script file was found if possible. Refer to the
INSTALL file for more general information about configuration of script
locations.

Configuration
=============

The script location syntax is specified as follows:

location = file:<path>[;<option>[=<value>][;...]]

The following additional options are recognized:

  active=<path>
    When ManageSieve is used, one script in the storage can be active; i.e.,
    evaluated at delivery. For the `file' location, the active script in the
    storage directory is pointed to by a symbolic link. This option configures
    where this symbolic link is located. If the `file' location path points to
    a regular file, this setting has no effect (and ManageSieve cannot be used).

Example
=======

plugin {
	...
  sieve = file:~/sieve;active=~/.dovecot.sieve

  sieve_default = file:/var/lib/dovecot/;name=default
}
